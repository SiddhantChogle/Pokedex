# Pokedex

This is one of my initial projects in flutter. The goal was to learn and practice the basics of flutter. Learned how to use Layout widgets and fetch data from APIs.

## Description

A Pokedex app of popular anime **Pokemon** which contains list of pokemons sorted by generations, along with their detailed Stats.
